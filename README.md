# Electromagnetic Fields and Numeric Methods Solutions

Numerical methods tend to be implemented in order to improve accuracy, being necessary to solve propagation problems applied to calculate electromagnetic fields.

### Finite differences time domain method (FDTD)

Finite differences time domain method (FDTD) is used as solution electromagnetic problems to simulate radio wave propagation in fields us which doesn't present uniform characteristics and the analytical analysis is not efficient, the calculation base is referenced on Maxwellâ€Ÿs equations discretized in time and space.

### Ray Tracing 

The 2D approach uses the beginning of the Geometrical Optics (GO) for the determination of the dispersed field. With base on the Image Theory, the possible paths are dear through rays that represent the propagation of the radio waves radiated by a source transceiver until a reception point, besides being a modeling with advantages accuracy

### Hybrid Method

A simple hybrid computational model was developed based on the combination the Ray Tracing and FDTD (Finite-difference time-domain) for the calculation of electromagnetic fields in indoor areas
